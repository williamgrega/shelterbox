				<h2>Joseph and Luncia</h2>
				<img src="jo.jpg" width = "120px">
				<p> After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013, Luncia Tragura and her grandson, Joseph ran to the village school to take shelter. They returned five days later to an empty plot of land in Dagami municipality on the Leyte islands. Their neighbors helped them put together a ramshackle coco-leaf structure with twisted corrugated iron roof salvaged from the storm wreckage. Joseph, now 18-years-old, had suffered from meningitis at the age of two, and was left with impaired speech and movement, and an inability to use his right arm. Luncia has raised him since his mother died in childbirth 14 years ago. At 78-years-old, she earns a modest income by working in the village and could not afford to rebuild the home that had been the product of a lifetime of earnings. When a ShelterBox Response Team, including Owen Smith set up their ShelterBox tent, Luncia cried. &quot;As we showed her the kitchen set, the ground mats and blankets, a huge and irrepressible smile broke out. We knew we had found a good home for the box,&quot; said Owen.</p>

				<h2>Mohammad Family</h2>

				<p>More than three years have passed since the conflict first began in Syria and 2.5 million refugees, 75 percent of them women and children, continue to survive in neighboring countries. Abo Mohammad and his family are from Damascus, where ongoing violence forced them to flee for safety. &quot;I remember walking in the street and a rocket would suddenly fall and hit a nearby car, killing everyone inside, or a man walking past you would suddenly be shot dead by a sniper,&quot; he said. While he hopes to return home in the future, he is glad his family is safe and has a place to live. Our ShelterBox response team members have been assessing several areas in the south of Malawi, including the district of Chikwawa, where they have found a desperate need for clean and safe shelter.  </p>
